# lightroom-purge-sidecars

A quick and dirty utility to read an Adobe Lightroom catalog and
remove the JPG sidecar files (from shooting in RAW+JPG mode).

Don't run this unless you really, really mean it. It will delete files
immediately (you DO have multiple, redundant, and off-site backups of
your photos, right?)
